        <h1>Privacy Policy for VIDHAR App</h1>
        <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> September 29, 2025</p>

        <p>This Privacy Policy describes how VIDHAR collects, uses, and handles your information when you use the VIDHAR mobile application (the "Service").</p>

        <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
        <p>We collect the following types of information to provide and improve our Service:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Personal Identification Information:</strong> To create and manage your account, we collect your Name, Email Address, and a unique User ID generated by our system.</li>
            <li><strong>Precise Location Data:</strong> We collect your precise GPS location data at the time of marking attendance to verify your presence in the classroom. This data is used solely for attendance verification.</li>
            <li><strong>Device Information:</strong> We collect a unique Device ID from your mobile device to ensure that each user account is tied to a single device for security and fraud prevention purposes.</li>
            <li><strong>App Performance Data:</strong> We automatically collect data on app performance, including crash logs and diagnostics, to identify and fix bugs and improve the stability of our Service.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
        <p>The information we collect is used for the following purposes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>To Provide and Maintain the Service:</strong> To operate the core functionalities of the app, such as creating your account, logging you in, and recording attendance.</li>
            <li><strong>For Account Management:</strong> To authenticate users and manage user accounts.</li>
            <li><strong>For Security and Fraud Prevention:</strong> To prevent unauthorized access and ensure that accounts are not used on multiple devices simultaneously.</li>
            <li><strong>For App Functionality and Analytics:</strong> To monitor app health, diagnose and fix crashes, and make performance improvements.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. Data Sharing and Disclosure</h2>
        <p>We do not sell, trade, or share your personal data with third parties for their marketing purposes.</p>
        <p>We use Firebase, a Google platform, as a service provider for backend services such as authentication, database management, and crash analytics. Data is transmitted to Firebase for the purposes outlined in this policy. Firebase's use of information is governed by its own privacy policy.</p>
        <p>We may disclose your information if required by law or in response to valid requests by public authorities.</p>

        <h2>4. Data Security</h2>
        <p>The security of your data is important to us. All data transmitted between your device and our servers is encrypted in transit using Transport Layer Security (TLS). We rely on the robust security measures of our service provider, Google Firebase, to protect your data at rest.</p>

        <h2>5. Data Retention and Deletion</h2>
        <p>We retain your personal data as long as your account is active. You have the right to request the deletion of your account and all associated personal data at any time. Instructions for requesting data deletion can be found on our Data Deletion page.</p>

        <h2>6. Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>Our Service is intended for university students and faculty and is not directed to anyone under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13.</p>

        <h2>7. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.</p>
